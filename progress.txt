# Plex Dashboard - Progress Log

# Codebase Patterns

Reusable patterns discovered during development. Update this section when you find something useful for future iterations.

## Backend Patterns

### Async Database Sessions
- Always use `AsyncSession` with `async def` endpoints
- Use `await db.execute()` then `.scalar_one_or_none()`
- Tests must also use async sessions to match production

### Password Hashing
- Use `bcrypt` directly (not passlib) for Python 3.12+ compatibility
- `bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode("utf-8"), bcrypt.gensalt())`

### Encrypted User Settings
- Use Fernet from `app/services/encryption.py`
- Store `*_encrypted` fields, return `*_configured` booleans in API responses
- Never return actual API keys in GET responses

### Protected Routes
- Use `get_current_user` dependency from `app/services/auth.py`
- Returns 401 if token invalid/missing

## Frontend Patterns

### API Contract Testing (vitest)
- Location: `frontend/tests/*.test.ts`
- Mock `fetch` with `vi.fn()`
- Test success, 401, 422 responses
- Example: `login.test.ts`, `register.test.ts`

### Auth Store
- Location: `frontend/src/lib/stores/auth.ts`
- Methods: `checkAuth()`, `logout()`, `setUser()`
- Layout checks auth on mount, redirects to /login if not authenticated

### E2E Testing (Playwright)
- Location: `frontend/e2e/*.spec.ts`
- Mock API responses with `page.route()`
- Test UI rendering, not business logic

## Docker Verification
- Always test backend changes in Docker before marking complete
- `docker-compose up --build -d`
- Test via curl: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/...`
- Check logs: `docker-compose logs backend`

## 2026-01-16: US-34.1 - Hide Issues Column on Unavailable Tab

### Summary
Hid the Issues column on the Unavailable tab to give more space to the content name column.

### Files Changed
- `frontend/src/routes/issues/+page.svelte` - Added conditional rendering for Issues column and CSS for expanded Name column

### Key Implementation Details
- Added `{#if activeFilter !== 'requests'}` around Issues column header and cells
- Added `class:requests-view={activeFilter === 'requests'}` to table element
- Added CSS rule `.requests-view .col-name { width: 45%; }` to expand Name column
- Other tabs (All, Old, Large, Language) still show the Issues column at 35% width

### Verification
- 411 frontend unit tests pass
- svelte-check passes (0 errors)
- Verified in browser: Unavailable tab has no Issues column, Name column is wider
- Verified in browser: All/Old tabs still show Issues column

---

## 2026-01-16: US-44.4 - Reset Password Endpoint

### Summary
Created POST /api/auth/reset-password endpoint that allows users to submit a new password using a valid reset token.

### Files Changed
- `backend/app/models/user.py` - Added `ResetPasswordRequest`, `ResetPasswordResponse` models and `validate_password_strength()` function
- `backend/app/routers/auth.py` - Added `reset_password` endpoint
- `backend/tests/test_password_reset.py` - Added 11 new unit tests (TestResetPasswordEndpoint class)
- `backend/tests/test_integration.py` - Added 3 integration tests for reset-password validation

### Key Implementation Details
- Password validation with Pydantic `field_validator`: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number
- Iterates through all non-expired, unused tokens and compares bcrypt hashes
- Updates user's `hashed_password` with new bcrypt hash
- Marks token as `used=True` to prevent reuse
- Returns 200 OK with success message on valid reset
- Returns 400 Bad Request for invalid/expired/used tokens
- Returns 422 Unprocessable Entity for weak passwords (validation)

### Verification
- 547 backend tests pass (11 new tests)
- mypy typecheck passes
- 9 auth integration tests pass in Docker

### Learnings
- Pydantic `field_validator` decorator runs during request parsing, catching validation errors before endpoint code
- bcrypt.checkpw is used to safely compare incoming token with stored hashes

---

## 2026-01-16: US-44.3 - Request Password Reset Endpoint

### Summary
Created POST /api/auth/request-password-reset endpoint that allows users to request a password reset email.

### Files Changed
- `backend/app/models/user.py` - Added `PasswordResetRequest` and `PasswordResetResponse` Pydantic models
- `backend/app/routers/auth.py` - Added `request_password_reset` endpoint and `_check_password_reset_rate_limit` helper
- `backend/app/services/rate_limit.py` - Added `password_reset_rate_limiter` (3 requests/email/hour)
- `backend/tests/test_password_reset.py` - Added 10 new unit tests for endpoint and rate limiting
- `backend/tests/test_integration.py` - Added 3 integration tests for password reset endpoint

### Key Implementation Details
- Generates secure random token: `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` (32 bytes, URL-safe base64)
- Hashes token with bcrypt before storage for security
- Token expires in 15 minutes from creation
- Deletes existing unused tokens for user before creating new one (only one active reset per user)
- Sends email via `send_password_reset_email()` service with reset URL
- Returns 200 OK even for non-existent emails (prevents email enumeration attacks)
- Rate limited to 3 requests per email per hour (in-memory RateLimiter keyed by email)

### Verification
- 533 backend tests pass (10 new tests + 3 integration tests)
- mypy typecheck passes
- 31 integration tests pass in Docker

### Learnings
- Rate limiting by email address (not IP) provides better protection for this endpoint
- The RateLimiter class has `_is_testing()` check that bypasses limits when TESTING=1
- For rate limit tests, must set TESTING=0 with `patch.dict(os.environ)` pattern

## 2026-01-16: US-44.2 - Email Service with SMTP2GO

### Summary
Created email service to send password reset emails using SMTP with STARTTLS.

### Files Changed
- `backend/app/config.py` - Added SMTP config settings (smtp_host, smtp_port, smtp_username, smtp_password, smtp_from_email, frontend_url)
- `backend/app/services/email.py` - New email service with send_password_reset_email() function
- `backend/tests/test_email.py` - 18 unit tests with mocked smtplib.SMTP

### Key Implementation Details
- Uses smtplib with STARTTLS for secure connection
- Sends both HTML and plain text email formats (multipart/alternative)
- Email includes: reset link (clickable), expiration time (15 minutes), user's email for reference
- Raises HTTPException 500 on SMTP errors (authentication, connection, general SMTP errors)
- Skips login if username/password are empty (for testing with local SMTP servers)
- Logs success message on email sent

### Verification
- 523 backend tests pass (18 new email tests)
- mypy typecheck passes

### Learnings
- smtplib context manager (`with`) automatically handles quit/disconnect
- MIMEMultipart("alternative") lets email clients choose HTML or plain text

---

## 2026-01-16: US-44.1 - Password Reset Token Model

### Summary
Created `PasswordResetToken` database model to store password reset tokens securely for the forgot password feature.

### Files Changed
- `backend/app/database.py` - Added `PasswordResetToken` model with all required fields
- `backend/alembic/versions/20260116_203015_*.py` - Migration to create table
- `backend/tests/test_password_reset.py` - Unit tests for model CRUD and constraints

### Key Implementation Details
- Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `token_hash`, `expires_at`, `created_at`, `used`
- `token_hash` column is indexed for fast lookup
- Foreign key to `users` table with `ON DELETE CASCADE` - tokens deleted when user is deleted
- `used` boolean flag to prevent token reuse

### Verification
- 505 backend tests pass (6 new tests for PasswordResetToken model)
- mypy typecheck passes
- 28 integration tests pass in Docker
- Table verified in Docker database with correct columns and foreign key

### Learnings
- CASCADE delete in SQLAlchemy requires `ondelete="CASCADE"` in ForeignKey definition
- SQLite in-memory tests may not enforce foreign keys (engine-specific behavior)

## 2026-01-16: US-33.1 - Calculate and Store Total Series Size

### Summary
Modified `calculate_season_sizes()` to also calculate and store the total series size (sum of all seasons) in `CachedMediaItem.size_bytes`. This enables the Library page to display actual series sizes instead of "Unknown size".

### Files Changed
- `backend/app/services/sync.py` - Added `total_series_size` accumulator, store in `size_bytes`
- `backend/tests/test_sync.py` - Added tests for total series size calculation

### Key Implementation Details
- `calculate_season_sizes()` now tracks both `largest_season_size` and `total_series_size`
- For each season, the season size is added to `total_series_size`
- After processing all seasons, `size_bytes` is updated with the total
- Log message now includes both total size and largest season size for debugging
- Frontend already uses `size_formatted` from API, so no frontend changes needed

### Verification
- 491 backend tests pass (added 1 new test for total series size)
- All 405 frontend tests pass
- mypy typecheck passes
- svelte-check passes
- 27 integration tests pass in Docker

### Learnings
- The `format_size()` function returns "Unknown size" when `size_bytes` is None or 0
- Once `size_bytes` is populated during sync, the Library page will automatically display proper sizes

---

## 2026-01-16: US-17.2.1 - Populate Sync Progress User Names

### Summary
Verified that sync progress user names feature was already fully implemented. No code changes needed - just marked the story as complete.

### Existing Implementation
- `backend/app/services/sync.py:456-460` - Extracts first user name in batch and passes to `update_sync_progress()`
- `frontend/src/routes/+page.svelte:159-160` - Displays "Fetching user X/Y: Name..." format

### Verification
- All 491 backend tests pass including `TestSyncProgressTracking` tests
- All 405 frontend tests pass including sync.test.ts and setup-checklist.test.ts
- Typecheck passes (mypy, svelte-check)
- Integration tests pass in Docker
- Visual verification attempted via Puppeteer (sync completes too fast to capture mid-progress)

### Key Implementation Details (Pre-existing)
- `fetch_jellyfin_media_with_progress()` processes users in batches of 3
- For each batch, it extracts the first user's display name: `first_user_name = batch_users[0].get("Name", "Unknown")`
- Passes this name to `update_sync_progress()` which stores it in `SyncStatus.current_user_name`
- API endpoint `/api/sync/status` returns the name in `progress.current_user_name`
- Frontend `formatProgressMessage()` formats: `Fetching user ${progress.current_step_progress}/${progress.current_step_total}: ${userName}...`

### Learnings
- Before implementing, always check if the feature is already complete by reviewing existing code
- The sync progress user names feature was implemented alongside the main sync progress tracking

## 2026-01-16: US-38.2 - Store French Titles During Sync

### Summary
Added ability to fetch and store French titles during sync, enabling future display of content in French.

### Files Changed
- `backend/app/database.py` - Added `title_fr` column to `CachedJellyseerrRequest` model
- `backend/app/services/sync.py` - Added `language` parameter to `fetch_media_details()`, added `extract_french_title_from_request()` helper, updated sync to fetch both English and French titles
- `backend/tests/test_sync.py` - Added tests for French title extraction and fetch_media_details with language
- `backend/alembic/versions/20260116_192531_*.py` - Migration for `title_fr` column

### Key Implementation Details
- `fetch_media_details()` now accepts `language` parameter (default: "en")
- During sync, the service makes two API calls per media item: one for English, one for French
- French titles are stored in `title_fr` (movies use `title_fr`, TV shows use `name_fr` from media details)
- `extract_french_title_from_request()` extracts French title from media object
- Missing French titles are stored as None (graceful degradation)
- Uses separate caches for EN and FR to avoid duplicate lookups

### Learnings
- The Jellyseerr API accepts a `language` parameter to fetch localized titles from TMDB
- Caching both languages separately prevents redundant API calls for the same TMDB ID

---

## 2026-01-16: US-38.1 - Add Title Language User Setting

### Summary
Added user setting to choose preferred language (English or French) for content titles. This is the first step toward supporting French title display.

### Files Changed
- `backend/app/database.py` - Added `title_language` column to `UserSettings` (String(2), default='en')
- `backend/app/models/settings.py` - Added `TitleLanguage` Literal type and fields to display preferences models
- `backend/app/routers/settings.py` - Updated GET/POST display endpoints to include `title_language`
- `backend/tests/test_integration.py` - Added integration tests for title_language API
- `backend/alembic/versions/20260116_191223_*.py` - Migration for `title_language` column
- `frontend/src/routes/settings/+page.svelte` - Added "Title language" dropdown to Display section

### Key Implementation Details
- TitleLanguage is a Literal type: `"en" | "fr"`
- Default value is "en" (English)
- Migration includes `server_default='en'` for existing rows
- Frontend dropdown saves on change (no save button needed)
- Includes proper loading states and error handling

### Learnings
- When adding a new NOT NULL column, always include `server_default` in migration for existing rows

## 2026-01-16: US-37.1 - Prefill Nicknames During Sync (Backend)

### Summary
Implemented automatic prefill of nickname records for all Jellyfin users during sync, including detection of users with Jellyseerr accounts.

### Files Changed
- `backend/app/database.py` - Added `has_jellyseerr_account` boolean field to `UserNickname` model
- `backend/app/models/settings.py` - Added `has_jellyseerr_account` to `NicknameItem` response model
- `backend/app/services/sync.py` - Added `fetch_jellyseerr_users()` and `prefill_user_nicknames()` functions
- `backend/app/services/nicknames.py` - Updated to include `has_jellyseerr_account` in list response
- `backend/app/routers/settings.py` - Updated nickname endpoints to return `has_jellyseerr_account`
- `backend/tests/test_nickname_prefill.py` - New test file for nickname prefill functionality
- `backend/tests/test_sync.py` - Updated existing tests to mock new functions
- `backend/tests/test_sync_mocked_integration.py` - Added Jellyseerr users mock
- `backend/alembic/versions/20260116_184830_*.py` - Migration for `has_jellyseerr_account` column

### Key Implementation Details
- `fetch_jellyseerr_users()` calls `/api/v1/user` endpoint and returns empty list on error (graceful degradation)
- `prefill_user_nicknames()` creates nickname records for each Jellyfin user during sync
  - Preserves existing mappings (only creates if not exists)
  - Matches Jellyfin usernames against Jellyseerr users (case-insensitive)
  - Sets `has_jellyseerr_account=True` for users found in Jellyseerr
- Display name is left empty for user to fill in later

### Learnings
- When adding new API calls to sync service, remember to update all existing sync tests to mock the new functions
- `respx` mocks require explicit routes for every HTTP call made during test

---

## 2026-01-16: US-37.3 - Manual Refresh Button for Jellyfin Users

### Summary
Added a "Refresh users" button on the Settings page that allows users to manually fetch Jellyfin users and populate the nickname list without waiting for the next sync.

### Files Changed
- `backend/app/models/settings.py` - Added `NicknameRefreshResponse` model
- `backend/app/routers/settings.py` - Added `POST /api/settings/nicknames/refresh` endpoint
- `backend/tests/test_settings.py` - Added 6 tests for refresh endpoint

- `frontend/src/routes/settings/+page.svelte` - Added "Refresh users" button with loading state
- `frontend/tests/settings-nicknames.test.ts` - Added 6 tests for refresh API contract

### Key Implementation Details
- Endpoint reuses existing `fetch_jellyfin_users()`, `fetch_jellyseerr_users()`, and `prefill_user_nicknames()` from sync service
- Returns 400 if Jellyfin not configured, 500 if Jellyfin API fails
- Response includes `success`, `message` (human-readable), and `new_users_count`
- Button only visible when `hasJellyfinConfigured` is true
- Shows loading spinner and disables button during refresh

### Verification
- 498 backend tests pass (6 new tests)
- 411 frontend tests pass (6 new tests)
- 28 integration tests pass (1 new test)
- mypy typecheck passes
- svelte-check passes

### Learnings
- Can reuse sync service functions in settings router by importing from `app.services.sync`
- Import `Any` from typing when using `dict[str, Any]` type hints

---

## 2025-01-16: US-28.1 - Loading States Accessibility

### Summary
Added accessibility attributes to loading states across all main pages so screen readers can announce loading status and content updates.

### Files Changed
- `frontend/src/routes/+page.svelte` - Dashboard with aria-busy, aria-live on stats grid
- `frontend/src/routes/issues/+page.svelte` - Issues page with aria-busy, aria-live on table
- `frontend/src/routes/settings/+page.svelte` - Settings page with aria-busy, role="status" on loading
- `frontend/src/routes/library/+page.svelte` - Library page with aria-busy, aria-live on table
- `frontend/src/routes/whitelist/+page.svelte` - Whitelist page with aria-busy, aria-live on list
- `frontend/src/routes/info/recent/+page.svelte` - Recent page with aria-busy, aria-live on table

### Key Implementation Details
- `aria-busy="true/false"` on parent containers (dashboard, issues-page, settings-page, library-page, whitelist-page, page) - dynamically set based on loading state
- `role="status"` and `aria-label="Loading..."` on loading div elements
- `aria-hidden="true"` on spinner elements (decorative)
- `aria-live="polite"` on table/list containers that update with content
- `aria-live="assertive"` on toast notifications

### Verification
- 523 backend tests pass
- 411 frontend tests pass
- svelte-check passes (0 errors)
- Verified in browser using Puppeteer - all aria attributes present

### Learnings
- `aria-busy` should be on the container that changes during load (toggles between content and loading state)
- `aria-live="polite"` announces updates without interrupting the user
- `aria-live="assertive"` for urgent messages like error toasts
- Spinners should have `aria-hidden="true"` since the `role="status"` on parent provides context

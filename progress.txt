# Plex Dashboard - Progress Log

# Codebase Patterns

Reusable patterns discovered during development. Update this section when you find something useful for future iterations.

## Backend Patterns

### Async Database Sessions
- Always use `AsyncSession` with `async def` endpoints
- Use `await db.execute()` then `.scalar_one_or_none()`
- Tests must also use async sessions to match production

### Password Hashing
- Use `bcrypt` directly (not passlib) for Python 3.12+ compatibility
- `bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode("utf-8"), bcrypt.gensalt())`

### Encrypted User Settings
- Use Fernet from `app/services/encryption.py`
- Store `*_encrypted` fields, return `*_configured` booleans in API responses
- Never return actual API keys in GET responses

### Protected Routes
- Use `get_current_user` dependency from `app/services/auth.py`
- Returns 401 if token invalid/missing

## Frontend Patterns

### API Contract Testing (vitest)
- Location: `frontend/tests/*.test.ts`
- Mock `fetch` with `vi.fn()`
- Test success, 401, 422 responses
- Example: `login.test.ts`, `register.test.ts`

### Auth Store
- Location: `frontend/src/lib/stores/auth.ts`
- Methods: `checkAuth()`, `logout()`, `setUser()`
- Layout checks auth on mount, redirects to /login if not authenticated

### E2E Testing (Playwright)
- Location: `frontend/e2e/*.spec.ts`
- Mock API responses with `page.route()`
- Test UI rendering, not business logic

## Docker Verification
- Always test backend changes in Docker before marking complete
- `docker-compose up --build -d`
- Test via curl: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/...`
- Check logs: `docker-compose logs backend`

## Current Status

**Phase**: Epic 27 - Testing (In Progress)
**Total Stories**: 41 stories (39 passes: true, 2 remaining)

## Notes

- US-0.2 (Dockerize) was completed together with US-0.1 since Docker setup was needed for testing
- Backend runs on port 8080 (mapped from 8000), Frontend on port 5173
- API proxy configured in vite.config.ts for dev environment
- Production: https://mediajanitor.com with HTTPS via Let's Encrypt
- CI/CD: Push to main triggers auto-deploy to VPS
